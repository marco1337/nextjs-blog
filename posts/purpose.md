Hello! This is the first entry on this blog. I will try to write at least once a week sharing my thoughts about different topics:

- Technology
- Politics
- Enterteinment
- and just whatever I think is interesting

I will try to update the blog as I write it. For the time being, this are the features I want to implement:

- Pictures in posts
- Filters by date
- Links for social media
- Send messages to email for contact

I will also try to post about my side projects to document the progress and maybe help some people with the same interests.

With this, I end this first entry.
